# Trains-planes
Train should be able to transport port plane if they are unable to commit to a distance that is too far. 
Trains that should have strength to carry planes that are unable to go far here are some of the ideas 

Imagine a meandering Midwestern railway constructed through difficult, sparsely settled territory and soon bankrupt as a result, discovering upon completion that it had been built between the wrong cities. It would attempt to rectify early mistakes through expensive acquisitions of adjoining railroads, and trackage rights on others, struggling to compete against larger systems on its two primary routes while encountering only marginal success in originating traffic. 



This is a example:
